#IGraphM â€“ igraph for Mathematica

##What is IGraphM?

IGraphM is a *Mathematica* interface to the [igraph](http://igraph.org/) graph manipulation and analysis library.  It works directly with *Mathematica*'s builtin `Graph` datatype and focuses on functionality that is either not already present in *Mathematica* (motifs, minimum feedback arc set, random rewiring, hierarchical random graphs, etc.), or for which igraph uses different implementations (isomorphism, sampling random graphs with given degree sequence, clique counts, etc.)

##Why IGraphM?

igraph is one of the broadest graph manipulation packages available.  Many of its functions are of use to Mathematica users, either because equivalents don't already exist in Mathematica, or because they can be used to verify Mathematica's own functions.  My previous package, [IGraphR][2], already provides relatively convenient access to all of R/igraph (igraph's R interface) from Mathematica, but unfortunately its underlying technology, [RLink](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/RLink/guide/RLink.html), suffers from reliability and performance problems.  IGraphM uses C/igraph through [LibraryLink](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/LibraryLink/tutorial/Overview.html), which makes it much faster, more robust and easier to use with Mathematica's parallel tools.

##Installation

Presently IGraphM does not come with precompiled binary components, so you need to compile it yourself.  It also depends on the [LTemplate package][1].  The installation steps are as follows:

 1. Place the `IGraphM` directory in `$UserBaseDirectory/Applications`
 2. Install `LTemplate` by placing it in the same location, `$UserBaseDirectory/Applications`
 3. Make sure the igraph headers and library are installed on your system.
 4. Edit `BuildSettings.m` within the `IGraphM` directory and set the location of the igraph library on your system.  Set up the compiler any special compiler options to use.  See the [CCompilerDriver User Guide](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/CCompilerDriver/tutorial/Overview.html) for details.
 5. Start Mathematica, load the package using ``<<IGraphM` ``, and evaluate `RecompileIGraphM[]`.  If there were no errors

##Contributions

Contributions to IGraphM are most welcome.  igraph is a large graph library with diverse functionality.  I primarily focused on providing an interface to functions that I need myself, and I do not have time to cover all igraph functions.  If you are interested in extending IGraphM, send me an email to get technical guidance.  IGraphM is uses the [LTemplate package][1], and acts as a driver for LTemplate development.  I recommend starting by reading the LTemplate tutorial.

Desired but not yet completed functionality:

 - hierarchical random graphs
 - spectral coarse graining
 - layout algorithms
 - community detection
 - graphlets

Remember, if you need to use any of these from *Mathematica* today, there is always [IGraphR][2].
